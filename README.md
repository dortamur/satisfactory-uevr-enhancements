# Satisfactory UEVR Enhancements

<img align="right" src="Resources/Icon128.png"/>This is a [mod for Satisfactory](https://ficsit.app/mod/UEVREnhancements) intended to accompany Praydog's [Unreal Engine Virtual Reality (UEVR) Tool](https://uevr.io/), to provide VR-specific UI and interaction enhancements, to make playing Satisfactory in VR more practical and enjoyable.

**This mod does not enable VR by itself!**<br/>
You will also need:
