# Satisfactory UEVR Enhancements

<img align="right" src="Resources/Icon128.png"/>This is a [mod for Satisfactory](https://ficsit.app/mod/UEVREnhancements) intended to accompany Praydog's [Unreal Engine Virtual Reality (UEVR) Tool](https://uevr.io/), to provide VR-specific UI and interaction enhancements, to make playing Satisfactory in VR more practical and enjoyable.

**This mod does not enable VR! It adds VR controls and interactions.** You will also need:
- Version [1.05 or newer](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR/releases) of the UEVR Tool
- The Satisfactory profile for UEVR depending on where you bought Satisfactory:
	- [UEVR Profile for Steam Satisfactory](https://github.com/dortamur/satisfactory-uevr-enhancements/raw/master/UEVR/FactoryGameSteam-Win64-Shipping.zip)
	- [UEVR Profile for Epic Store Satisfactory](https://github.com/dortamur/satisfactory-uevr-enhancements/raw/master/UEVR/FactoryGameEGS-Win64-Shipping.zip).

See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/dortamur/satisfactory-uevr-enhancements/wiki/Getting-Started) page for full installation details, and the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/dortamur/satisfactory-uevr-enhancements/wiki/Troubleshooting) page if you have problems getting it working.
